				<h1>Advantages and benefits of using Big Data</h1>

				<div class="article2content">	<h3>Using big data cuts your costs</h3>


A recent Tech Cocktail article looks at how Twiddy & Company Realtors cut their costs by 15%. The company compared maintenance charges for contractors against the average of its other vendors.

												<h3>Using big data increases your efficiency</h3>
			Using digital technology tools boosts your business’s efficiency. From using tools such as Google Maps, Google Earth, and social media, you can do many tasks right at your desk without having travel expenses. These tools save a great amount of time, too.

												<h3>Using big data improves your pricing</h3>
			Use a business intelligence tool to evaluate your finances, which can give you a clearer picture of where your business stands.
												<h3> You can compete with big businesses</h3>
			Using the same tools that big businesses do allows you to be on the same playing field. Your business becomes more sophisticated by taking advantage of tools that are available for your use.

												<h3>Allows you to focus on local preferences</h3>
			Small businesses should focus on the local environment they cater to. Big Data allows you to zoom in on your local client’s likes/dislikes and preferences even more. When your business gets to know your customer’s preferences combined with a personal touch, you’ll have an advantage over your competition.
												<h3>Using big data helps you increase sales and loyalty</h3>
			The digital footprints that we leave behind reveal a great deal of insight into our shopping preferences, beliefs, etc. This data allows businesses to tailor their products and services to exactly what the customer wants. A digital footprint is left behind when your customers are browsing online and posting to social media channels.
												<h3>Using big data ensures you hire the right employees</h3>
			Recruiting companies can scan candidate’s resumes and LinkedIn profiles for keywords that would match the job description. The hiring process is no longer based on what the candidate looks like on paper and how they are perceived in person.
